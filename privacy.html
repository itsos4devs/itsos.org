            <li>We need to perform a contract with you</li>
            <li>You have given us permission to do so</li>
            <li>The processing is in our legitimate interests and it’s not overridden by your rights</li>

            <h3>Transfer of Data</h3>
            <p>Your information, including Personal Data, may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ than those from your jurisdiction.</p>
            <p>If you are located outside United States and choose to provide information to us, please note that we transfer the data, including Personal Data, to United States and process it there.</p>
            <p>Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>
            <p>ITSOS COMMUNITY will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and no transfer of your Personal Data will take place to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place including the security of your data and other personal information.</p>
            <h3>Disclosure of Data</h3>
            <h4><em>Business Transaction</em></h4>
            <p>If ITSOS COMMUNITY is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, your Personal Data may be transferred. We will provide notice before your Personal Data is transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.</p>
            <h3><em>Disclosure for Law Enforcement</em></h3>
            <p>Under certain circumstances, ITSOS COMMUNITY may be required to disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g. a court or a government agency).</p>
            <h3><em>Legal Requirements</em></h3>
            <p>ITSOS COMMUNITY may disclose your Personal Data in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>To comply with a legal obligation</li>
            <li>To protect and defend the rights or property of ITSOS COMMUNITY</li>

            <li>To protect the personal safety of users of the Service or the public</li>
            <li>To protect against legal liability</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Security of Data</h3>
            <p>The security of your data is important to us but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

            <p>You can opt-out of having made your activity on the Service available to Google Analytics by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on.

            <p>We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.</p>
            <h3>Children’s Privacy</h3>
